# minard_chart
Inspired by the very famous 
[Minard Map](http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/229-vital-statistics-of-a-deadly-campaign-the-minard-map), 
this project is aimed to track the evolution of a few current sheets in 3D MHD simulations over time, 
with the line thickness set to be proportional to the magnitude of the current density, while the orientation
of the branch flows indicate the merger/fragmentation events. 

The plotting make use of the [D3-trail](https://github.com/bmschmidt/D3-trail) javascript.
